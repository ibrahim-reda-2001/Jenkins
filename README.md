## 📝 Project Overview  
This repository contains hands-on projects and configurations for learning **Jenkins**, the leading open-source automation server for CI/CD (Continuous Integration and Delivery). The projects are part of my DevOps journey with **NTI**, guided by **Eng Mohamed Salem**.  

Key focuses include:  
- **Pipeline-as-Code** (Jenkinsfile)  
- **Automated Builds, Tests, and Deployments**  
- **Integration with Docker, AWS, and GitHub**  
- **Security and Best Practices**

## 🛠️ Features  
- **Jenkins Pipelines**: Declarative and Scripted pipelines for automating workflows.  
- **Docker Integration**: Building, testing, and deploying containerized applications.  
- **Cloud Automation**: AWS EC2 instance provisioning, S3 bucket management, and more.  
- **GitHub Webhooks**: Triggering Jenkins jobs automatically on code commits.  
- **Security**: Role-based access control (RBAC), credential management, and SSL setup.
